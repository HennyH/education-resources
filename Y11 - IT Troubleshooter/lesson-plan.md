# Troubleshooting

In this lesson students will learn how to use decision trees to troubleshoot various technical issues involving faulty monitors, no power to the computer, and printing problems. This two lesson sequence is designed to be a collaborate and engaging way to cover this content - it allows students to create 'scenario' files which a Python program interprets to create a troubleshooter program.

## Learning Objectives

1. Students can apply troubleshooting techniques in the following situations: faulty monitor, no power to computer, printer not working.
2. Students can identify common peripheral devices and why they might be malfunctioning.
3. Students can work collaberativley to create a troubleshooting scenario definition.
4. Students are able to use the command line to invoke a Python program with a named parameter.
5. Students can explain how a programs operation can be influenced by user input.

## Sequence

### Part 1

1. [00:05:05] I write an observation on the board: "I moved the mouse but couldn't see anything on the screen", I then ask what is a TEST I could perform to narrow down what could be causing the problem? I then tell them the answer to their test (based upon the scenario I have in my head - I know what the actual problem is!), I draw what we've covered so far as a tree. I repeat this process several times until we either arrive at the problem or they require some assistance. We will have produced a 'decision tree', this terminology is introduced - including the vocabularly "nodes", "leaf nodes", "tree", and "branch".
2. [05:20:25] Students are given an A3 piece of paper on which they will construct a decision tree graph with a partner to diagnose a printer not working.
3. [25:10:35] Demo the troubleshooter program and explain the syntax of the scenario files.
4. [35:20:55] As a class have them follow along with the creation of a scenario file based upon their printer decision trees. I write the code and they copy it, but my code is based upon the classes printer decision trees.
5. [55:05:60] Students experiment with running the troubleshooter program on the scenario file.


### Part 2

1. [00:05:05] Discuss if decision trees and the trouble shooter program could be used in the repair or diagnosing of mechanical equipment.
4. [05:45:50] Students are walked through the section of the assignment pertaining to the creation of a scenario file. Students then spend the lesson working on the scenario file to be submitted as part of their project.
2. [50:10:60] I choose a student to demo their scenario file, to do so I describe a problem (i.e the HDMI cable is damaged) and we see if their scenaro file correctly identifies the issue. As a class we discuss what might be done to improve the scenario file.

Extension

1. Advanced students can use the parameterization of nodes to create generic troubleshooting steps.
2. Advanced students can add image support to nodes.
3. Advanced students can enhance the troubleshooter UI.


## Feedback

### 14th May

- hardware trouble shooting aim for 2 lessons
- have them exchange files and test it out
- come up with a problem and see if their program helps
