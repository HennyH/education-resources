// === Guessing Game (10 Points) ===
// Write a program which lets the user play a number guessing game.
// The game should allow users to enter a guess until it matches the number,
// when they guess the correct number print "You guessed it in X guesses" (where
// X is the number of times they guessed a number) and the program
// should stop. If the guess is above the number print out "Too Hot", otherwise,
// if it is less than the number print "Too Cold".
//
// Assumptions:
// 1. There exists a function called `Random(Lower, Upper)` which returns a random integer
// between `Lower` and `Upper` inclusive.
